# IAR-ReinforcementLearning
This project's goal is to reproduce the experiment done by LONG-JI LIN in 1992 in his article entitled [Self-Improving Reactive Agents Based On
Reinforcement Learning, Planning and Teaching ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992699#article-info).

In order to spice it up a bit, we'll have a good looking display.

The project is done for educational purposes.
